# Arcaea Web Project
This is the web project for the Arcaea mobile game. The idea is to create a website that allows players to fetch the information about songs, characters, and any other elements of the game. 

## Here's the Website !
Please refer to the [Arcaea Song List](https://omeilab.github.io/Arcaea-Web-Project/) for the website.
